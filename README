Assumptions / Comments (if any):
I am working on a Windows machine. So there are some problems if run on a Linux machine.
I checked my code using del since rm is not there in Windows. I did not change any other contents in this directory.
Like del in place of rm in MakeFile, Compiling the out file is down by p1\p1.out, Input from text file is taken Manually.
# Is the program complete? Are there any assumptions made? Any other comments?
The Program is complete for possible Test Cases. I gave 2 Test Cases. I could not redirect input from the text file
on Windows.
So, I took Input from the Terminal Manually. Input is stopped by clicking Ctrl+Z in Terminal.
Approach :
# How do you solve this problem?
I first created a char array of size 8*8 which represents each place in the board. First, the char array is 
Initialised(using initialize function).For every matched input, the update function is called and the char 
array is updated based on the moves for both white and black. The update is designed for normal capturing, 
empty space occupying and also for updating pawn to Queen/B/R/N when in the last or first row. 
Then after the END of Input, the board is printed in required format(using print_board).
